## Banking application with API

## I decided against using controllers
Using controllers and having templets being generated for me would have made this much easier. 
after some research I found that banking systems dont use controllers but a DTO.
I found this interesting and a good time for me to learn something new. 
I tackled the DTO head on with coding pratices I had learnt at my previous job. 
but with that being said I also went against some of the clean code 
(By this im talking the use of var and not including regions).


This was a fun exercise to do. 
Hopefully this will provide I have some knowledge and I AM WILLING TO LEARN NEW THINGS.
Also shows that I know how to leverage AI to help me writing okay UnitTests xD

##Hope to hear a lovely response back xD
